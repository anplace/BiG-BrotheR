## BiG-BrotheR

## Description
This is a CLI application to add employees, roles, and departments within a database. This allows the user the ability to update employees, their roles within the company, salaries, to move employees, create departments, etc. 


## Technologies & Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It's the foundation of your application, enabling the use of JavaScript outside the browser.

2. **MySQL**: A popular open-source relational database management system. MySQL is used to store and manage the data for your application, including departments, roles, and employee information.

3. **MySQL2**: A Node.js package that provides an interface to interact with your MySQL database. It allows your application to run SQL queries, retrieve data, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

4. **Inquirer.js**: A Node.js package that provides a user-friendly interface for command-line input. It's used to create interactive prompts in the terminal, allowing users to input and select data in the application.

5. **dotenv**: A Node.js module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. It's used to manage sensitive information, like database connection details, securely and separately from the codebase.

6. **Figlet**: A Node.js library for creating ASCII art from text. In your application, it's used to display stylized text in the command line interface for aesthetic purposes.

7. **console.table**: A package (or built-in console method in newer Node.js versions) that provides a simple way to display tabular data in the console. It's used to display the data retrieved from the MySQL database in a structured table format.

These technologies work together to create an interactive, command-line-based employee management system that can perform various operations related to managing departments, roles, and employees within a company.
